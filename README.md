# dotnet-library-checklist

A work-in-progress "living" checklist of things to do as a .NET library author.

TODO (in no particular order):
- Deterministic Builds (what it means, why it is useful)
- Source Link and PDBs
- Preparing for trimming: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/prepare-libraries-for-trimming
- Async/ConfigureAwait (Simple explanation of who/what/why)
- Binary Compatibility (what is it, how to avoid issues etc)
- Private Build Dependencies
- Performance Considerations (eg. use and/or expose Span implementations, ArrayPool etc)
- Testing (less of a focus on testing in general but nuances of multi-platform use of complicated libraries)
